          "A young girl sits in the middle of a room in a psychiatric ward. She has removed all of her clothes and is rocking back and forth.The hospital staff has invited a visiting doctor to look in on the patient. They talk about the girl, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia: for a long time now, she has done nothing but rock, and she has not spoken since being admitted many months ago. They ask the visitor’s opinion.His response is wordless: he takes off all his clothes and steps into her room.He sits down next to the girl and begins to rock in sync with her, two naked figures side by side.This goes on for a while. This goes on for 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes.And then she speaks to him. Her first words in nearly 200 days.Later, the visitor will ask the staff, “Did it never occur to you to do that?”"),

Having no preconceived ideas or constraints, symbols, vistas and recognizable objects suggest themselves.Unexpected and surprising, they appear without apparent intent, but are open to the possibilities of development and transformation, the artist continued.Trajectories can lead anywhere … and everywhere."),

          "On August 10, 1991, a rusty tanker called the Mazal II docked at the industrial port of Ordu, in Turkey, and pumped twenty-two hundred tons of hazelnut oil into its hold. The ship then embarked on a meandering voyage through the Mediterranean and the North Sea. By September 21st, when the Mazal II reached Barletta, a port in Puglia, in southern Italy, its cargo had become, on the ship’s official documents, Greek olive oil. It slipped through customs, possibly with the connivance of an official, was piped into tanker trucks, and was delivered to the refinery of Riolio, an Italian olive-oil producer based in Barletta. There it was sold—in some instances blended with real olive oil—to Riolio customers"),

          "CHERYL WHITTLE TRIED HER BEST to fall asleep, but her mind kept racing. Tomorrow was going to be the culmination of three years of research and, possibly, a day that would change her life forever.Around four a.m. she popped two Benadryl and managed to drift off. But in just a few hours she had to be up and ready to go.Cheryl and her husband, Dickie, are retired, and live in eastern Virginia, way out on the end of the Northern Neck peninsula, which juts like an arthritic finger into Chesapeake Bay. It’s a beautiful and isolated spot, where most people tack up “No Trespassing” signs and stay close to home. The Whittles enjoy their life in the country, but Cheryl was eager that day to make the long drive to meet Effie Jane."),
